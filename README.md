# EmailSpamDetection

The Email Spam Detection project leverages machine learning to classify emails as spam or non-spam. This project begins with collecting a dataset of labeled emails and preprocesses the text through cleaning and tokenization. It then transforms the text data into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF. After that, it uses the Naive Bayes model to train the data, with a split between training and testing sets. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring robustness through cross-validation. The project also implements a pipeline to streamline the entire process, from preprocessing and feature extraction to model training and evaluation, making it easy to replicate and extend for future improvements.
